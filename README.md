<h1>Bilhete Único Digital API</h1>

> ## This is an API that is consumed by the Bilhete Único Digital mobile application and the bus turnstile prototype developed by the company Vértice, using Arduino. It enables features such as simulating ticket payments, consuming tickets at the turnstile while considering the type of ticket, whether it has full or partial fare exemption, viewing available tickets, and real-time ticket integration.

  ## Abstract

  > The "Digital Single Ticket" project proposes the implementation of an innovative application to replace the conventional single ticket system used in the city of São Paulo. Coupled with the application, a prototype of a low-cost electronic turnstile using Arduino has been developed, which will be capable of reading the QR code generated by the application, potentially replacing the conventional turnstiles used on buses in the city of São Paulo. This application aims to enhance the experience of public transportation users by offering a digitized and integrated solution for payment and access to transportation services. The Digital Single Ticket offers a mobile platform that allows users to conveniently load credits through secure online transactions, eliminating the dependence on physical recharge points. Additionally, the application provides an intuitive interface for credit management, trip history inquiries, and real-time notifications about available balance. Noteworthy is the integration of the Digital Single Ticket with various modes of transportation, including buses, subways, trains, and ride-hailing services, promoting a smoother and intermodal travel experience for users. In summary, the Digital Single Ticket represents an innovative and technologically advanced proposal to modernize the public transportation system in São Paulo, offering convenience, efficiency, and accessibility to users while driving the digitization and optimization of urban services offered by the city. 

Keywords: public transportation. Application. Arduino. single ticket. digitization.

> ## Some Implementations

- [X] Complete login system
- [X] User registration system with email code confirmation
- [X] Complete CRUD system for passengers and their relations, such as tickets, trips, and credit cards
- [X] It is possible to view the integration of the used ticket in real-time. In São Paulo, the integration lasts for two hours
- [X] Validation when scanning the ticket QR code, for example: checking if there are available trips, if the ticket has fare exemption, or if it can be used consecutively for a companion in the case of a ticket for a passenger with a physical disability.
- [X] Photo upload for passenger profile
      

> ## Instalation and Use
 ### Requirements: You will need to have XAMPP and Composer installed on your computer.
1. Create the database using the [administrative section](https://github.com/hucarvalho/bilhete-unico-digital-adm) of Bilhete Único Digital. To do this, you need to clone the repository and follow the installation and usage steps.
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project folder in a terminal and type: "composer install".
5. Also, type "php artisan storage:link" to ensure photo uploads work correctly.
6. After that, type "php artisan serve" to run the project. It will be accessible by default at "localhost:8000".
7. To test the API, you can use the [routes file](https://github.com/hucarvalho/bilhete-unico-digital-api/blob/main/routes/api.php) as a guide. The URL address will be "localhost:(selected port)/api".
8. Follow the step-by-step instructions on how to use the [Bilhete Único Digital mobile application](https://github.com/moiseshxs/Bilhete_Unico_Digital) and correctly consume the API.
